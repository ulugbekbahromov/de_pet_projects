3. Final product
Sam is going to maintain a CSV of directors with their emails, numbers, and department. She will use that list to create subscriptions to the trash_notifications topic she creates.

4. Final product
Then, she will check the final_report.csv created in the previous chapter. If illegal dumping case count exceeds 30, she will publish to the trash_notifications topic. All the subscribers from contacts.csv will receive it.
